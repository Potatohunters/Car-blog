        <h2 class="title">How to develop an electric hypercar during a pandemic</h2>
        <p class="date">&#8212 2022/10/10</p>
        <li class="tag">Electric Hypercar</li>
        <p class="content">
            When Automobili Pininfarina set out a development and testing programme for its 1900bhp, 217mph Battista electric hypercar, the disruption of a global pandemic clearly wasn’t part of the plan.
But with customers already told that deliveries were due to begin in late summer 2021, the company knuckled down, adapted its programme and forged on with development.
Nine prototypes have now been built, including three dynamic evaluation cars sent to southern Italy for as full an engineering development programme as possible.
“It has been challenging, yes, and things have gone more slowly than we planned,” said Automobili Pininfarina CEO Per Svantesson, “but we remain on course for job one in 2021.”
The Swede comes across as unflappable and determined – attributes much needed during the pandemic response – and says he has committed up to 17 hours a day to video meetings from his Munich home to keep the Battista project and its 110 staff on track. “My wife brings me meals at my desk and the day moves on,” he joked.
The coronavirus couldn’t have timed its arrival in Europe better if disrupting the Battista project was the goal. Work was just starting on the first prototype, the test programme was due to step up a level and a management reshuffle had elevated Svantesson to CEO.

        <h2 class="title">DELAGE D12 HYPERCAR</h2>
        <p class="date">&#8212 2022/09/21</p>
        <li class="tag">Hypercar</li>
        <li class="tag">Delage</li>
        <p class="content">
            Don't worry if you've never heard of Delage — the French carmaker hasn't produced anything since 1953. During Delage's heyday in the 1920s and '30s, they were making successful race cars. Post-WWII, the company collapsed in the face of stiff postwar competition, but now they're back under CEO Laurent Tapie with a V12 hypercar and a lofty goal — setting the lap record at the legendary Nurburgring. The Delage D12 is powered by an in-house designed 7.6-liter V12 making 1,100 horsepower in the D12 GT or 1,010 in the D12 Club. An eight-speed transmission is used in both versions, with the GT getting a 90-horsepower electric motor as well, along with a curb weight of just over 3,000 pounds. The Club weighs in at only 2,888, with both cars having a carbon fiber monocoque chassis, bodywork, and wheels. The design is aerodynamic in the extreme, drawing heavily from Formula One, with a central driver's seat and passenger seat mounted directly behind like a fighter jet. The D12 will start production in early 2021 with just 30 being made.

        <h2 class="title">'Is a 1,000bhp hypercar really relevant these days?'</h2>

            The undoubted star of this week’s Frankfurt Motor Show is – as you might expect – a car so bold and so brazen that it deserved its place in history even before the covers came off.
Mercedes-AMG’s Project ONE hypercar may not be a beauty, but you can’t argue with the depth of engineering that has gone into what Mercedes describes as “the first Formula One car with MoT approval”. And, you’ll be pleased to hear, much of that incredible work was done by Mercedes-AMG’s talented workforce here in the UK.
• Everything from the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show
You can read the full story and marvel over the Project ONE’s stats, but you have to wonder whether there’s still a place for a road car with this level of performance in 2017?
The biggest issue is where you can enjoy the outstanding performance on offer these days, although one would hope that your multi-million pound outlay would buy you some serious track time to fully explore the Project ONE (and Lewis Hamilton to show you how).
As someone who believes that 0-30mph is a more important indicator of fun these days than 0-60mph, I wonder if the promised instant acceleration from the Project ONE’s electric drivetrain is a clue to the real relevance of this car.

        <h2 class="title">FIA APPROVES 'HYPERCAR' LMP1 RULES FOR FUTURE WEC</h2>
        <p class="date">&#8212 2022/09/04</p>
        <li class="tag">Hypercar</li>
        <li class="tag">FIA</li>
        <p class="content">
            The FIA confirmed the change in the LMP1 rules for the 2020/21 World Endurance Championship which will help the manufacturers and privateers to design and build race cars based on the ‘hypercar’ concept.
In addition, the budget is targeted to be ‘one quarter of the current LMP1 budgets’ to make it feasible for either parties to compete in the championship. The move allows for the use of road-relevant sportscars for racing, thereby manufacturers’ influx in the series.
Further, the governing body also approved the plans to encourage more female racers in the championship. The detailed view of the regulations will be conveyed during the Le Mans 24 Hours race week.
The FIA’s statement read as:
A summary of the ongoing discussions regarding the 2020 Technical Regulations for the highest category of FIA WEC was presented as follows:
•	Targeted budget of one quarter of current LMP1 budgets.    
•	Freedom of design for brands based on a ‘Hypercar’ concept.
A plan to encourage the participation of female drivers in the FIA World Endurance Championship was approved.
Details on both points above will be presented during the week of the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
A proposal to modify the length of the Sebring competition from 1500 miles to 1000 miles with effect from the 2019 competition was approved.

        <h2 class="title">Zenvo Will Reveal New Hardcore Hypercar At Geneva</h2>
        <p class="date">&#8212 2022/08/27</p>
        <li class="tag">Hypercar</li>
        <li class="tag">Zenvo</li>
        <p class="content">
            At last year's Geneva Motor Show, you may remember Denmark's high-performance car manufacturer Zenvo revealed the TS1 GT to the world: An insane hypercar with an impressive 1,163-hp on tap. Powered by a 5.8-liter V8 engine equipped with a pair of superchargers, that monumental power was sent to the wheels via a seven-speed sequential racing gearbox. It can do 0-62 mph in a blistering 2.8 seconds and reach an electronically limited top speed of 233 mph.
Frankly, it's hard to imagine how Zenvo can top the TS1 GT's insane performance, but we'll find out at this year's Geneva Motor Show where the Danish automaker will reveal a new hypercar. Details are being kept closely under wraps for now, but Zenvo's CEO Angela Kashina has teased that he expects "the most demanding of hypercar enthusiasts to be delighted at this latest development." The unnamed hypercar will be the third to join Zenvo's line-up, following the twin supercharged TS1 GT and TSR models, which are both based on the original ST1. Teaser photos show the car's front bumper and prominent spoiler lip with extensive use of carbon fiber.
This could well be be the Danish company's most hardcore and track-focused hypercar yet, but whether it will be an all-new model or an even more extreme version of the TS1 GT remains to be seen. Fortunately we don't have long to wait to find out, as the Geneva Motor Show kicks off in just over a month on March 6. "With everything now in place to launch this fantastic new model onto the market it is hard for us to wait patiently for the Geneva International Motor Show to share this car with the world, Zenvo CEO Angela Kashina said. "The fact that we are holding back to the opening day of the exhibition on March 6 is a testimony to how much we value this event.
